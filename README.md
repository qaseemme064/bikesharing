# Overview
This Tableau story can be seen on [this link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/qaseem4746/viz/CitiBikeAnalysis_16492560359050/Story1?publish=yes)

The objective for this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. This analysis might help answer a few key questions:

1) Who uses bikeshare programs?
2) What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
3) How much are the bikes used and by whom?

# Results

## **Visualization # 1**

In the below image we can see that there are 2,344,224 trips and more than 3/4 of the users are Subscribers, who make regular use of the bikes and are a predictable source of income for the program. Bikeshare program users are mostly male, and approximatley 1/4 female. The remaining gender is unknown or undeclared

## **Visualization # 4**
The below heat map  also shows that the high usage of bikes are by male. We can also see that the usage of bike is always higher from 7am to 9am and even more high usage in between 4pm to 7pm in weekdays. On the weekends the usage is consistant throught the day.

# Summary

So Overall, 
* bikeshare services are pretty popular in busy metropolitan areas.
* The user base is mostly of male subscribers, which is the good source of income to the program. 
* The main usage seems focused around morning and evening commute times.

Further analysis and visualization can be done, if the data is provided, I would explore:

1) trip starting and ending locations during morning and evening rush hour time-windows, to display the flow of traffic between neighborhoods at peak hours

2) average trip duration, by birth year, by gender, to explore if there was any difference in male or female or un-gendered riders as they age.
